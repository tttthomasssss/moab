@inproceedings{Lapesa_2017,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a large-scale evaluation study of dependency-based
	distributional semantic models. We evaluate dependency-filtered and
	dependency-structured DSMs in a number of standard semantic similarity tasks,
	systematically exploring their parameter space in order to give them a "fair
	shot" against window-based models.  Our results show that properly tuned
	window-based DSMs still outperform the dependency-based models in most tasks. 
	There appears to be little need for the language-dependent resources and
	computational cost associated with syntactic analysis.},

@inproceedings{Gamallo_2017,
	Abstract = {This article describes a method to build semantic representations of composite
	expressions in a compositional way by using WordNet relations to represent the
	meaning of words. The meaning of a target word is modelled as a vector in which
	its semantically related words are assigned weights according to both the type
	of the relationship and the distance to the target word. Word vectors are
	compositionally combined by syntactic dependencies. Each syntactic dependency
	triggers two complementary compositional functions: the named head function and
	 dependent function. The experiments show that the proposed compositional
	method outperforms the state-of-the-art for both intransitive subject-verb and
	transitive subject-verb-object constructions.},

	phrases such as \emph{spelling bee} are an integral part of natural language
	\cite{Sag\_2002}.  They are also the phrases that are difficult, or even
	impossible, for good compositional distributional models of semantics. 
	Compositionality detection therefore provides a good testbed for compositional
	methods. We compare an integrated compositional distributional approach, using
	sparse high dimensional representations, with the ad-hoc compositional approach
	of applying simple composition operations to state-of-the-art neural
	embeddings.},

	is strictly necessary or whether the meaning of a word in context can be
	disambiguated through composition alone. We evaluate the performance of
	off-the-shelf single-vector and multi-sense vector models on a benchmark phrase
	similarity task and a novel task for word-sense discrimination. We find that
	single-sense vector models perform as well or better than multi-sense vector
	models despite arguably less clean elementary representations. Our findings

	Abstract = {The Paraphrase Database (PPDB; Ganitkevitch et al., 2013) is an
extensive semantic resource, consisting of a list of phrase pairs with
(heuristic) confidence estimates. However, it is still unclear how it can
best be used, due to the heuristic nature of the confidences and its
necessarily incomplete coverage. We propose models to leverage the phrase
pairs from the PPDB to build parametric paraphrase models that score
paraphrase pairs more accurately than the PPDB{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s internal scores while
simultaneously improving its coverage. They allow for learning phrase
embeddings as well as improved word embeddings. Moreover, we introduce two
new, manually annotated datasets to evaluate short-phrase paraphrasing
models. Using our paraphrase model trained using PPDB, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on standard word and bigram similarity tasks and
beat strong baselines on our new short phrase paraphrase tasks.},

@article{Hill_2016,
	Abstract = {Distributional models that learn rich semantic word representations are a success story of recent NLP research. However, developing models that learn useful representations of phrases and sentences has proved far harder. We propose using the definitions found in everyday dictionaries as a means of bridging this gap between lexical and phrasal semantics. Neural language embedding models can be effectively trained to map dictionary definitions (phrases) to (lexical) representations of the words defined by those definitions. We present two applications of these architectures: 'reverse dictionaries' that return the name of a concept given a definition or description and general-knowledge crossword question answerers. On both tasks, neural language embedding models trained on definitions from a handful of freely-available lexical resources perform as well or better than existing commercial systems that rely on significant task-specific engineering. The results highlight the effectiveness of both neural embedding architectures and definition-based training for developing models that understand phrases and sentences. },

	Abstract = {{Confidence intervals are widely accepted as a preferred way to present study results. They encompass significance tests and provide an estimate of the magnitude of the effect. However, comparisons of correlations still rely heavily on significance testing. The persistence of this practice is caused primarily by the lack of simple yet accurate procedures that can maintain coverage at the nominal level in a nonlopsided manner. The purpose of this article is to present a general approach to constructing approximate confidence intervals for differences between (a) 2 independent correlations, (b) 2 overlapping correlations, (c) 2 nonoverlapping correlations, and (d) 2 independent R2s. The distinctive feature of this approach is its acknowledgment of the asymmetry of sampling distributions for single correlations. This approach requires only the availability of confidence limits for the separate correlations and, for correlated correlations, a method for taking into account the dependency between correlations. These closed-form procedures are shown by simulation studies to provide very satisfactory results in small to moderate sample sizes. The proposed approach is illustrated with worked examples.}},

Word2vec has racked up plenty of citations because it satisifies both of Kuhn's conditions for emerging trends: (1) a few initial (promising, if not convincing) successes that motivate early adopters (students) to do more, as well as (2) leaving plenty of room for early adopters to contribute and benefit by doing so. The fact that Google has so much to say on `How does word2vec work' makes it clear that the definitive answer to that question has yet to be written. It also helps citation counts to distribute code and data to make it that much easier for the next generation to take advantage of the opportunities (and cite your work in the process).},

@article{Moro_2014,
	Abstract = {Entity Linking (EL) and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) both address the lexical ambiguity of language. But while the two tasks are pretty similar, they differ in a fundamental respect: in EL the textual mention can be linked to a named entity which may or may not contain the exact mention, while in WSD there is a perfect match between the word form (better, its lemma) and a suitable word sense. In this paper we present Babelfy, a unified graph-based approach to EL and WSD based on a loose identification of candidate meanings coupled with a densest subgraph heuristic which selects high-coherence semantic interpretations. Our experiments show state-of- the-art performances on both tasks on 6 different datasets, including a multilingual setting. Babelfy is online at http://babelfy.org },

words for a variety of NLP tasks, but learning embeddings for phrases can be
challenging. While separate embeddings are learned for each word, this is
infeasible for every phrase. We construct phrase embeddings by learning how
to compose word embeddings using features that capture phrase structure and
context. We propose efficient unsupervised and task-specific learning
objectives that scale our model to large datasets. We demonstrate
improvements on both language modeling and several phrase semantic
similarity tasks with various phrase lengths. We make the implementation of
our model and the datasets available for general use.},

Each sentence token is associated with a BiLSTM vector representing the token in its sentential context, and feature vectors are constructed by concatenating a few BiLSTM vectors. The BiLSTM is trained jointly with the parser objective, resulting in very effective feature extractors for parsing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by applying it to a greedy transition-based parser as well as to a globally optimized graph-based parser. The resulting parsers have very simple architectures, and match or surpass the state-of-the-art accuracies on English and Chinese.},

@techreport{Zweig_2011,
	Abstract = {

Work on modeling semantics in text is progressing quickly, yet there are few existing public datasets which authors can use to measure and compare their systems. This work takes a step towards addressing this issue. We present the MSR Sentence Completion Challenge Data, which consists of 1,040 sentences, each of which has four impostor sentences, in which a single (fixed) word in the original sentence has been replaced by an impostor word with similar occurrence statistics. For each sentence the task is then to determine which of the five choices for that word is the correct one. This data was constructed from Project Gutenberg data. Seed sentences were selected from Sherlock Holmes novels, and then imposter words were suggested with the aid of a language model trained on over 500 19th century novels. The language model was used to compute 30 alternative words for a given low frequency word in a sentence, and human judges then picked the 4 best impostor words, based on a set of provided guidelines. Although the data presented here will not be changed, this is still a work in progress, and we plan to add similar datasets based on other sources. This technical report is a living document and will be updated appropriately as new datasets are constructed and new results on existing datasets (for example, using human subjects) are reported.

@article{Bullinaria_2012,
	Abstract = {In a previous article, we presented a systematic computational study of the extraction of semantic representations from the word--word co-occurrence statistics of large text corpora. The conclusion was that semantic vectors of pointwise mutual information values from very small co-occurrence windows, together with a cosine distance measure, consistently resulted in the best representations across a range of psychologically relevant semantic tasks. This article extends that study by investigating the use of three further factors---namely, the application of stop-lists, word stemming, and dimensionality reduction using singular value decomposition (SVD)---that have been used to provide improved performance elsewhere. It also introduces an additional semantic task and explores the advantages of using a much larger corpus. This leads to the discovery and analysis of improved SVD-based methods for generating semantic representations (that provide new state-of-the-art performance on a standard TOEFL task) and the identification and discussion of problems and misleading results that can arise without a full systematic study.},

	Abstract = {Recent trends suggest that neural-network-inspired word embedding models outperform traditional count-based distributional models on word similarity and analogy detection tasks. We reveal that much of the performance gains of word embeddings are due to certain system design choices and hyperparameter optimizations, rather than the embedding algorithms themselves. Furthermore, we show that these modifications can be transferred to traditional distributional models, yielding similar gains. In contrast to prior reports, we observe mostly local or insignificant performance differences between the methods, with no global advantage to any single approach over the others.},

	Abstract = {A procedure that processes a corpus of text and produces numeric vectors containing information about its meanings for each word is presented. This procedure is applied to a large corpus of natural language text taken from Usenet, and the resulting vectors are examined to determine what information is contained within them. These vectors provide the coordinates in a high-dimensional space in which word relationships can be analyzed. Analyses of both vector similarity and multidimensional scaling demonstrate that there is significant semantic information carried in the vectors. A comparison of vector similarity with human reaction times in a single-word priming experiment is presented. These vectors provide the basis for a representational model of semantic memory, hyperspace analogue to language (HAL).},

@article{Pelletier_1994,
	Abstract = {The Principle of Semantic Compositionality (sometimes
called 'Frege's Principle') is the principle that the meaning of
a (syntactically complex) whole is a function only of the meanings
of its (syntactic) parts together with the manner in which these parts
were combined. This principle has been extremely influential
throughout the history of formal semantics; it has had a tremendous
impact upon modern linguistics ever since Montague Grammars
became known; and it has more recently shown up as a guiding
principle for a certain direction in cognitive science.
Despite the fact that The Principle is vague or underspecified at
a number of points - such as what meaning is, what counts as a part, what counts as a syntactic complex, what counts as combination -
this has not stopped some people from viewing The Principle as
obviously true, true almost by definition. And it has not stopped other
people from viewing The Principle as false, almost pernicious in its
effect. And some of these latter theorists think that it is an empirically
false principle while others think of it as a methodologically
wrong-headed way to proceed.
In fact, there are approximately 318 arguments against The
Principle which can be found in the literature, whereas there are only
three (or maybe four) arguments proposed in favor of The Principle.
This paper will adjudicate among these arguments. And at the end
it will suggest some other way to look at what proponents of
compositionality really want.},

	Abstract = {Previous work on Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) shows that these models can produce compositional feature vectors for accurately representing and classifying sentences or images. However, the sentence vectors of previous models cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the DT-RNN model which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space in order to retrieve images that are described by those sentences. Unlike previous RNN-based models which use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus on the action and agents in a sentence. They are better able to abstract from the details of word order and syntactic expression. DT-RNNs outperform other recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA and a bag-of-words baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence description and vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences that describe the same image.},

Three methods of analysis to a type of extension of principal components analysis are discussed. Methods II and III are applicable to analysis of data collected for a large sample of individuals. An extension of the model is described in which allowance is made for unique variance for each combination variable when the data are collected for a large sample of individuals.},
