@article{Bullinaria_2012,
	Abstract = {In a previous article, we presented a systematic computational study of the extraction of semantic representations from the word--word co-occurrence statistics of large text corpora. The conclusion was that semantic vectors of pointwise mutual information values from very small co-occurrence windows, together with a cosine distance measure, consistently resulted in the best representations across a range of psychologically relevant semantic tasks. This article extends that study by investigating the use of three further factors---namely, the application of stop-lists, word stemming, and dimensionality reduction using singular value decomposition (SVD)---that have been used to provide improved performance elsewhere. It also introduces an additional semantic task and explores the advantages of using a much larger corpus. This leads to the discovery and analysis of improved SVD-based methods for generating semantic representations (that provide new state-of-the-art performance on a standard TOEFL task) and the identification and discussion of problems and misleading results that can arise without a full systematic study.},

@article{Levy_2015,
	Abstract = {Recent trends suggest that neural-network-inspired word embedding models outperform traditional count-based distributional models on word similarity and analogy detection tasks. We reveal that much of the performance gains of word embeddings are due to certain system design choices and hyperparameter optimizations, rather than the embedding algorithms themselves. Furthermore, we show that these modifications can be transferred to traditional distributional models, yielding similar gains. In contrast to prior reports, we observe mostly local or insignificant performance differences between the methods, with no global advantage to any single approach over the others.},

	Abstract = {A procedure that processes a corpus of text and produces numeric vectors containing information about its meanings for each word is presented. This procedure is applied to a large corpus of natural language text taken from Usenet, and the resulting vectors are examined to determine what information is contained within them. These vectors provide the coordinates in a high-dimensional space in which word relationships can be analyzed. Analyses of both vector similarity and multidimensional scaling demonstrate that there is significant semantic information carried in the vectors. A comparison of vector similarity with human reaction times in a single-word priming experiment is presented. These vectors provide the basis for a representational model of semantic memory, hyperspace analogue to language (HAL).},

@article{Pelletier_1994,
	Abstract = {The Principle of Semantic Compositionality (sometimes
called 'Frege's Principle') is the principle that the meaning of
a (syntactically complex) whole is a function only of the meanings
of its (syntactic) parts together with the manner in which these parts
were combined. This principle has been extremely influential
throughout the history of formal semantics; it has had a tremendous
impact upon modern linguistics ever since Montague Grammars
became known; and it has more recently shown up as a guiding
principle for a certain direction in cognitive science.
Despite the fact that The Principle is vague or underspecified at
a number of points - such as what meaning is, what counts as a part, what counts as a syntactic complex, what counts as combination -
this has not stopped some people from viewing The Principle as
obviously true, true almost by definition. And it has not stopped other
people from viewing The Principle as false, almost pernicious in its
effect. And some of these latter theorists think that it is an empirically
false principle while others think of it as a methodologically
wrong-headed way to proceed.
In fact, there are approximately 318 arguments against The
Principle which can be found in the literature, whereas there are only
three (or maybe four) arguments proposed in favor of The Principle.
This paper will adjudicate among these arguments. And at the end
it will suggest some other way to look at what proponents of
compositionality really want.},

	Abstract = {Previous work on Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) shows that these models can produce compositional feature vectors for accurately representing and classifying sentences or images. However, the sentence vectors of previous models cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the DT-RNN model which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space in order to retrieve images that are described by those sentences. Unlike previous RNN-based models which use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus on the action and agents in a sentence. They are better able to abstract from the details of word order and syntactic expression. DT-RNNs outperform other recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA and a bag-of-words baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence description and vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences that describe the same image.},

Three methods of analysis to a type of extension of principal components analysis are discussed. Methods II and III are applicable to analysis of data collected for a large sample of individuals. An extension of the model is described in which allowance is made for unique variance for each combination variable when the data are collected for a large sample of individuals.},
